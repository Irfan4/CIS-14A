Project 1 Specifications: Metric Conversion

Write a program to convert a U.S. Customary System length in miles,
yards, feet, and inches to a Metric System length in kilometers,
meters, and centimeters. A Sample run is shown below. After the number
of miles, yards, feet, and inches are read from the text boxes, the
length should be converted entirely to inches and then divided by
39.37 to obtain the value in meters. The Int function should be used
to break the total number of meters into a whole number of kilometers
and meters. The number of centimeters should be displayed to one
decimal place. Use the naming convention provided for all controls on
the form and all variables used. The needed formulas are as follows:
dblTotal_inches = (63360 * intMiles) + (36 * intYards) + (12 *
intFeet) + intInches
dblTotal_meters = dblTotal_inches / 39.37
intKilometers = Int(dblTotal_meters/1000)
