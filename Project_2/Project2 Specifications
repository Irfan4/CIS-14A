Project 2: Fast Food Menu

Write a program to place an order from the restaurant menu (see pics).
Write the program so that each group box is invisible and becomes
visible only when its corresponding check box is checked. After the
"Total Cost" button is clicked, the cost of the meal should be
calculated. (Note: The Checked property of the first radio button in
each group box should be set to True in its Properties window. This
guarantees that a selection is made in each visible group box. Of
course, when the cost of the meal is calculated only the visible group
boxes should be considered). When the "Reset" button is pressed,
program should be ready for the next order.
