Project3 Specifications: Depreciation to a Salvage Value of 0.

For tax purposes an item may be depreciated over a period of several
years, n. With the straight-line method of depreciation, each year the
item depreciates by 1/nth of its original value. With the doubledeclining-
balance method of depreciation, each year the item
depreciates by 2/nths of its value at the beginning of that year. (In
the final year it is depreciated by its value at the beginning of the
year.) Write a program that performs the following tasks:

the item, the number of years to be dpreciated (estimated life), and
